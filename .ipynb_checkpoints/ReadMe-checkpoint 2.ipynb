    "The dataset in the *data* folder is a subset of the Jester Online dataset for joke recommendation. The original data contains 4.1 Million continuous-valued ratings (between -10.00 to +10.00) of 100 jokes from 73,421 users. The data was collected between April 1999 - May 2003. You can access to the original dataset from following link: http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/jester-data/. \n",
